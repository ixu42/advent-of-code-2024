# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎅

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions!
This repo is my playground for solving the daily programming puzzles of AoC 2024 using **C++**. 🎁

## ✨ Why?
- 🛠️ Practice C++
- 🌟 Sharpen problem-solving skills
- 🎉 Get into the holiday spirit

## 📜 Usage
- `make run DAY=<day_number>`: Compile and run the program for a specific day (e.g., `make run DAY=01`).
- `make leaks DAY=<day_number>`: Check memory leaks using `valgrind` for a specific day (e.g., `make leaks DAY=01`).
- `make clean`: Remove the compiled binaries to clean the project directory.
- `make help`: Display usage of Makefile in the terminal
