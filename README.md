# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ…

This repo contains my code and given input for solving the daily programming puzzles of [AoC 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) using **C++**.

## ðŸ“œ Usage
- `make run DAY=<day_number>`: Compile and run the program for a specific day (e.g., `make run DAY=01`).
- `make leaks DAY=<day_number>`: Check memory leaks using `valgrind` for a specific day (e.g., `make leaks DAY=01`).
- `make clean`: Remove the compiled binaries to clean the project directory.
- `make help`: Display usage of Makefile in the terminal.
